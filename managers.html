            <h1>About this manual</h1>
          </div>
          <p class="lead">The WILL Site Manual was designed and written for three distinct audiences: Content creators, Project or website section owners, and site managers (including developers and designers). The Site Managers section contains documentation on how the site was built in the CMS. A deep understanding of the site architecture can be attained by studying this site manual, along with <a href="https://ellislab.com/expressionengine/user-guide/">the user guide for ExpressionEngine</a>.</p>
          <p>This site manual is hosted as <a href="https://github.com/willpublicmedia/sitemanual">a repository on GitHub</a>, and served as a project of the <a href="https://github.com/willpublicmedia">GitHub organization willpublicmedia</a>. It uses <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to create pages, which makes it easy to use includes for page elements like navigation and the footer. GitHub works natively with Jekyll on the server-side, so you don't need to install anything locally other than git.</p> 
          <p>As further development is done with the WILL website, please keep the Site Manual up to date.</p>

        <!-- Site Manual maintenance on GitHub
        ================================================== -->
        <section id="github">
          <div class="page-header">
            <h2>Site Manual maintenance on GitHub</h2>
          </div>
          <p class="lead">Here are the basic commands to update the Site Manual via git and GitHub.</p>
          <p>The Master branch is of course Master, but the sitemanual is served to the web via the branch gh-pages. For the skinny on how this works see <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/">https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/</a></p> 
          <p>So gh-pages serves the sitemanual but I prefer to update the Master branch and then push those changes to gh-pages. Once Master is up to date, this command pushes Master to gh-pages</p>
          <h3>Editing the Site Manual pages</h3>
          <p>Assuming you have cloned the Master branch to a local directory, you can simply edit the files using your favorite text editor and save them locally. Here are the basic commands to update the local git repository and then push them to the Master branch on GitHub:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>git status</code> (optional, it just shows if anything in the local repository has been changed)</li>
            <li><code>git add -A</code> (adds all changes to the local git and make them ready to commit)</li>
            <li><code>git commit -m "comment about whatever was changed"</code> (creates a new version instance, along with a comment on what changed)</li>
            <li><code>git push origin master</code> (pushes the changes to the Master branch on GitHub)</li>
          </ul>
          <p> Finally, since the Master branch doesn't actually serve the sitemanual we need to do this: <code>git push origin master:gh-pages</code>. That pushes the changes made to the Master branch to the gh-pages branch which serves the actual pages.</p>

    <!-- Sitemanual Design<
    ================================================== -->

            <h2>Sitemanual Design</h2>
          </div>
          <p class="lead">Every CMS-driven website consists of a bundle of things, like a file system, a database, scripts, and possibly a framework. Here's what we're using:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>ExpressionEngine CMS, running on a LAMP stack inside a virtual machine. Everything from the VM on up to the CMS is managed by Taylor Judd, our Internet Technology Specialist/SysAdmin.</li>
            <li>the Bootstrap framework, mentioned above. The core Bootstrap files are in the <code>/themes/site_themes/will2.1</code> folder on the server. These files include all the Bootstrap JavaScript, the never-edit-these Bootstrap stylesheets, an images folder containing theme images, and a plugins folder for additional JS and CSS files. You'll also find a 'weather' folder here which contains custom JS and CSS files for the /weather page.</li>
            <li>Overrides of default Boostrap styles, and custom styles defined for the WILL 2.1 site, are contained in the file custom.css.</li>
            <li>We're using MediaElement.js for our audio players. All the files for this are in <code>/themes/site_themes/mediaelement</code>.</li>
            <li>The folder <code>/will2.1/plugins/weather</code> contains the JavaScript used on the weather/index page. Inside this folder, the images folder contains a set of weather icons used by the Yahoo Weather plugin that generates the weather icon seen in the header of every page.</li>
            <li>All the EE addon files are contained in <code>/ipmsys/expressionengine/third_party</code>, and <code>/themes/third_party</code>, the default location for EE addons.</li>
            <li>We also set up a very important folder for uploading files through EE Entry forms: <code>/nfs</code> contains a large number of mp3 audio files, plus PDF documents and other allowed filetypes uploaded with entries for use on the site. The NFS share is mapped from the web server, and <strong>is not part of the standard EE install</strong>.</li>
          </ul>
