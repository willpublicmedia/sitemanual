# WILL-Website-Manual
**A complete reference to WILL website structure, content creation, and editorial guidelines for authors, project managers, designers**

The website manual is generated from GitHub pages by Jekyll, and is available as public html pages at http://willpublicmedia.github.io/sitemanual/

The GitHub pages are generated automatically when updates are pushed to the gh-pages branch. If you wish to make updates, you can either clone and work on that branch directly, or clone and work on the Master branch, then push it back up and do a pull request to merge it with the gh-pages branch. Preferably the latter for better documentation.
