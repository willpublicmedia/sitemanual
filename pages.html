    <!-- About WILL Pages    ================================================== -->
        <section id="will-pages">
          <div class="page-header">
            <h1>WILL Pages</h1>
          </div>
          <p class="lead">The website contains many unique pages that are maintained in the channel called WILL Pages. Each entry in WILL Pages is given a Pages URI, which is different from a normal EE entry url in that it can be anything. The entry is also assigned to a specific template via the Template dropdown list. For example our About page is a WILL Page entry given the Pages URI of “/about”, and assigned to the template “pages/about”. </p>
          <p>WILL Pages are stand-alone web pages that are mostly static. They could be hand-coded but that would require any edits to be made by the Webmaster, so we're using the EE Pages Module to maintain them. There are a few <strong>very important pages</strong> with particular quirks.</p>
          <p>Most WILL Pages are straightforward. But there are a few fairly complicated Pages that require special care when editing. We keep the WILL Pages section fairly locked down in terms of user access for this reason.</p>
          <p><strong>Several entries include markup that is stripped by ExpressionEngine when you reopen the entry for editing. This is actually the WYGWAM field (Description) trying to protect from malicious code being injected into the database. WYGWAM strips out key part of the markup, messing up the entire page. The solution is to edit the markup in a standard text/html editor, then paste it into the WYGWAM Description field in Source view. WYGWAM doesn’t mess up the markup on save, just upon re-opening the entry for editing.</strong></p>

        <!-- Contribute to WILL
        ================================================== -->
        <section id="contribute">
          <div class="page-header">
            <h2>Contribute to WILL</h2>
          </div>
          <p class="lead">The most important WILL Page is the Contribute to WILL page. This has the url <a href="http://will.illinois.edu/support/pledgeform">http://will.illinois.edu/support/pledgeform</a>, and also the alias url <a href="http://willpledge.org">http://willpledge.org</a>. You'll find it in the WILL Pages section with the title of "Contribute to WILL". The Description field of this entry contains links to our pledge forms. These forms are hosted on another server: the Allegiance Web Module server. The forms themselves are created and maintained by Brenda Zimmerman in WILL's Development department. </p>
          <p>Brenda creates new forms from time to time, and will then give the Web department links to the new forms.  Edit the <em>Contribute to WILL</em> WILL Pages entry to update its links to the new forms. The for URLs are typically very long and hashy.</p> 

          <p>The "Contribute to WILL" WILL Pages entry contains Bootstrap and other markup that must be entered into the Description WYGWAM field as html. It also contains some custom classes that get stipped by WYGWAM upon opening the entry, which breaks the page design. The solution is to edit the markup outside of EE, then paste it into the entry's Description field in Source view.</p>
          <h3>Markup for Contribute to WILL page, last updated on 8/29/2015</h3>
          <p>Copy this code, edit as needed, and paste it into the WILL Pages entry "Contribute to WILL" in the Description field in Source view.</p>

          <div class="page-header">
            <h2>Corporate Support</h2>
          </div>
          <p>This WILL Page contains complex markup including a Collapse section and html5 <audio> content including some JavaScript for the player.</p>
          <p><em>Repeating: Don’t try to edit this in EE</em>. Paste the markup into WYGWAM in Source view and it’ll save just fine. But when you re-open the entry, WYGWAM mangles the markup. </p>
          <p>Don’t even bother trying to edit this within the entry.</p>
