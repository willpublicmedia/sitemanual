          <p class="lead">WILL Pages are stand-alone web pages that are mostly static. They could be hand-coded but that would require any edits to be made by the Webmaster, so we're using the EE Pages Module to maintain them. There are a few <strong>very important pages</strong> with particular quirks.</p>

        <!-- Contribute to WILL
        ================================================== -->
        <section id="contribute">
          <div class="page-header">
            <h2>Contribute to WILL</h2>
          </div>
          <p class="lead">The most important WILL Page is the <a href="http://willpledge.org">Contribute to WILL</a> page. You'll find it in the WILL Pages section and its title is (duh) "Contribute to WILL". The Description field of this entry contains links to our currently-valid pledge forms. These forms are hosted on another server: the Allegiance Web Module server hosted at AITS. The forms themselves are created and maintained by Brenda Zimmerman in WILL's Development department. </p>
          <p>Brenda creates new forms from time to time, and will then give you links to the new forms. You will simply edit the <em>Contribute to WILL</em> WILL Pages entry to update its links to the new forms. The for URLs are typically very long and hashy, so it's easiest to edit the source code for this entry rather than using the WYSWYG.</p> 
          <p>Because this is a "money page," and editing source code without error is iffy at best for most staff, it's important to <strong>edit this page yourself</strong>  and don't let anyone else touch it.</p>
